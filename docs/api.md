# HTTP API

open-mem exposes an HTTP API when the [dashboard](/dashboard) is enabled. It serves both the dashboard UI and a programmatic REST API. All endpoints are local-only — the server binds to `localhost` on the configured port.

Use this API when you want to integrate with open-mem outside of MCP tools, or build custom tooling against the observation store.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:3737
```

The port is configurable via `OPEN_MEM_DASHBOARD_PORT`. Endpoints use `/v1/` for memory and runtime operations, and `/api/` for configuration management.

## Config Control Plane

### Get Config Schema

```
GET /api/config/schema
```

Returns the JSON schema for all configuration fields.

### Get Effective Config

```
GET /api/config/effective
```

Returns the current effective configuration with metadata about the source of each value (default, config file, environment variable, or programmatic override).

### Preview Config Change

```
POST /api/config/preview
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "maxContextTokens": 2000,
  "retentionDays": 30
}
```

Returns what the effective config would look like with the proposed changes, without applying them.

### Apply Config Change

```
PATCH /api/config
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "maxContextTokens": 2000,
  "retentionDays": 30
}
```

Persists the changes to `.open-mem/config.json`.

## Mode Presets

### List Presets

```
GET /v1/modes
```

Returns available configuration presets (balanced, focus, chill) with their config patches.

### Apply Preset

```
POST /v1/modes/:id/apply
```

Applies a mode preset to the project config. See [Configuration — Mode Presets](/configuration#mode-presets) for what each preset changes.

## Workflow Modes

### List Workflow Modes

```
GET /v1/workflow-modes
```

Returns the loaded workflow mode definitions. Each mode specifies observation types, concept vocabulary, entity types for knowledge graph extraction, and relationship types.

## Memory Endpoints

### List Observations

```
GET /v1/memory/observations?limit=50&offset=0&type=decision&sessionId=...&state=current
